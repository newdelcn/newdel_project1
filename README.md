# About This Project #

About the main work of this project, we explore data modeling when there are only few positive samples by using different oversample rate, undersample rate.

If there is only a very few positive sample, using suitable oversample rate, undersample rate, positive sample, the model can get a relatively good results.

But it is doubtful whether it can be extended to the general situation.

Because of the need for confidentiality, we did not provide the data about this project.
